    <h3>Instructions: </h3>
        <h4>Making Buttery Dough</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, take the instant yeast, sugar. Add water and stir the mixture to dissolve the sugar and yeast granules.</li>
                <li>Then add 1 cup whole wheat flour and stir or whisk it with the rest of the yeast mixture.</li>
                <li>Cover and keep aside to leaven for 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Then add the remaining whole wheat flour, salt, softened butter and curd/yogurt. Knead to a soft, pliable and smooth dough.</li>
                <li>If the dough become sticky, add a few tablespoons of flour and knead again. If its dry, then add some more water.</li>
                <li>Cover the naan dough and keep aside for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into medium balls.</li>
                <li>Give a resting time for the dough balls for about 15 to 20 minutes. Cover and keep aside.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Assembling And Rolling</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly dust the dough balls with some flour. </li>
                <li>You can also sprinkle some sesame seeds or nigella seeds on the dough ball and then roll it.</li>
                <li>Roll into a small to medium sized rounds of medium thickness.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Cooking Butter Naan</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the rolled flat bread on a hot tawa or flat skillet. Keep the heat to medium-high to high.</li>
                <li>When the bottom is partly cooked, flip. You will see many air pockets on the naan.</li>
                <li>When the second side is half cooked, remove the naan with a pair of tongs and place the side which was cooked first facing the fire.</li>
                <li>The naan may puff up. Flip and brown the second side also. Ensure the naan is cooked well but don't over roast it.</li>
                <li>Place the hot naan in a roti basket or casserole. Spread some softened butter on top.</li>
                <li>Make all butter naans this way in batches. If not serving straight away, then stack them in the roti basket.</li>
                <li>Or else you can serve Butter Naan immediately.</li>
            </ol>
