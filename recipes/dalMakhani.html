    <h3>Instructions: </h3>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak both the whole urad dal and rajma overnight in enough water for 8 to 9 hours or overnight. Later drain them well.</li>
                <li>Rinse both the lentils a couple of times in water.</li>
                <li>Drain again and then add them in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Add water and stir well.</li>
                <li>Pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles on a high flame, till both the urad dal and rajma have cooked thoroughly and softened. If they are not cooked, then add about ½ cup water again and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles more.</li>
                <li>The urad dal should melt in the mouth and should not give any bite or resistance when eaten. You can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to check the doneness. The same rule applies for rajma too. Keep the cooked beans aside.</li>
                <li>In a blender or mixer jar, take chopped tomatoes and blend to a smooth puree. Set aside.</li>
                <li>You can also add ready 1 cup tomato puree instead of blending the tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes while pureeing.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Making Dal Makhani</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a pan, now heat butter. You can use salted butter or unsalted butter.</li>
                <li>Add the whole spices - cumin seeds, cloves, green cardamoms, black cardamom, 1 inch cinnamon, 1 small to medium tej patta.</li>
                <li>Fry for some seconds till the spices sputter and become aromatic.</li>
                <li>Add finely chopped onions.</li>
                <li>Stir and sauté the onions on a low or medium-low heat often till they become light golden.</li>
                <li>Add the ginger garlic paste. Stir again and sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped green chilies and sauté for a minute.</li>
                <li>Add the prepared tomato puree and mix well.</li>
                <li>Add red chili powder and 2 to 3 pinches of grated nutmeg or nutmeg powder.</li>
                <li>Stir very well and sauté this mixture on a low to medium flame, till you see fat releasing from the sides.</li>
                <li>Then add the cooked urad dal and rajma beans along with the stock. Also add 1 cup water or as required.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Slow Cooking</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir very well and simmer the dal makhani uncovered on a low flame.</li>
                <li>Keep on stirring often, so that the lentils don't stuck to the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Once it has begun to thicken, add salt as required.</li>
                <li>Stir very well and continue to simmer on a low flame. Keep on stirring when the lentils are simmered on low heat.</li>
                <li>When simmering you can add more water if the gravy looks thick or dry. The longer you keep dal makhani to simmer, the better it tastes.</li>
                <li>I kept it for about an overall 25 minutes on a low flame. Do keep on stirring at intervals.</li>
                <li>When the gravy has thickened enough, then add cream. Dal makhani is not too thick or too thin. It has a medium consistency.</li>
                <li>Mix the cream very well. Then switch off the heat.</li>
                <li>Add crushed kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). Mix again.</li>
                <li>Cover and set dal makhani aside, if you are proceeding to the dhungar method. Or else you can serve dal makhni straight away.</li>
